# Super Mario Bros

Can a computer learn to play super mario bros?
Yes.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/rjkilpatrick/mario-rl
cd mario-rl
conda install
conda activate rjkilpatrick-mario-rl
jupyter notebook .
```

## The Project

In this case we use a process called [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) which uses deep learning to approximate a reward function.
By optimizing a reward function (which is the premise of _most_ games), you can 'play' a game.
